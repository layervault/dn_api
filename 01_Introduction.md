## Introduction
The Designer News API provides a simple HTTP based REST based mechanism for interacting with Designer News and allowing applications to access user information via oAuth 2 authenticated requests, over SSL. API responses are simple JSON objects.

**Please note:** This API is no longer in active development. If you are looking to build an application for Designer
News, please refer to the [DN API v2](/v2.html).
